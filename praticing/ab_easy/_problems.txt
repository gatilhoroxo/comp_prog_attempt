Easy (just ‘a bit’ harder than the ‘Super Easy’ ones)

1. UVa 00621 - Secret Research (case analysis for only 4 possible outputs)
    2. UVa 10114 - Loansome Car Buyer * (just simulate the process)
3. UVa 10300 - Ecological Premium (ignore the number of animals)
4. UVa 10963 - The Swallowing Ground (for two blocks to be mergable, the
gaps between their columns must be the same)
5. UVa 11332 - Summing Digits (simple recursions)
    6. UVa 11559 - Event Planning * (one linear pass)
7. UVa 11679 - Sub-prime (check if after simulation all banks have ≥ 0 reserve)
8. UVa 11764 - Jumping Mario (one linear scan to count high+low jumps)
    9. UVa 11799 - Horror Dash * (one linear scan to find the max value)
10. UVa 11942 - Lumberjack Sequencing (check if input is sorted asc/descending)
11. UVa 12015 - Google is Feeling Lucky (traverse the list twice)
12. UVa 12157 - Tariff Plan (LA 4405, KualaLumpur08, compute and compare)
13. UVa 12468 - Zapping (easy; there are only 4 possibilities)
14. UVa 12503 - Robot Instructions (easy simulation)
15. UVa 12554 - A Special ... Song (simulation)
16. IOI 2010 - Cluedo (use 3 pointers)
17. IOI 2010 - Memory (use 2 linear pass)
