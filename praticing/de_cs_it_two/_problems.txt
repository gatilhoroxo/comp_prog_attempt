• CS Iterative (Two Nested Loops)

1. UVa 00105 - The Skyline Problem (height map, sweep left-right)
2. UVa 00347 - Run, Run, Runaround ... (simulate the process)
3. UVa 00471 - Magic Numbers (somewhat similar to UVa 725)
4. UVa 00617 - Nonstop Travel (try all integer speeds from 30 to 60 mph)
5. UVa 00725 - Division (elaborated in this section)
    6. UVa 01260 - Sales * (LA 4843, Daejeon10, check all)
7. UVa 10041 - Vito’s Family (try all possible location of Vito’s House)
    8. UVa 10487 - Closest Sums * (sort and then do O(n2) pairings)
9. UVa 10730 - Antiarithmetic? (2 nested loops with pruning can pass possibly
pass the weaker test cases; note that this brute force solution is too slow for
the larger test data generated in the solution of UVa 11129)
    10. UVa 11242 - Tour de France * (plus sorting)
11. UVa 12488 - Start Grid (2 nested loops; simulate overtaking process)
12. UVa 12583 - Memory Overflow (2 nested loops; be careful of overcounting)
